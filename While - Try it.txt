### Use a while loop to solve the following problem: A slow, but determined, walker sets 
### off from Leicester to cover the 102 miles to London at 2 miles per hour. Another walker 
### sets off from London heading to Leicester going at 1 mile per hour. Where do they meet?

London = 0
Leicester = 102
walking = True

while walking:
    if London < Leicester:
        print("Still walking from London! On mile {}".format(London))
        print("Still walking from Leicester! On mile {}".format(Leicester))
        London += 2
        Leicester -=1
    else:
        walking = False
else:
    print("Meet at mile {}".format(Leicester))
